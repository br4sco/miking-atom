# Miking language package

This package provides basic syntax highlighting for
[mcore](https://github.com/miking-lang/miking). Currently it only provides a
textmate grammar, adopted form https://github.com/miking-lang/miking-vscode.

You can find an in progress tree-sitter grammar for mcore
[here](https://github.com/br4sco/tree-sitter-mcore). Contributions are welcome.
